## What is Layout Mobile?

Layout Mobile is a **white-label mobile ordering platform** for multi-location merchants who already run on **Square**. You keep your existing point-of-sale and kitchen display; we add a customer-facing app that stays in sync with your catalog, locations, and payments.

- **Branded experience** — Your logo, colors, and menu in a native iOS app.
- **Square-native** — Connect once via Square; catalog, locations, and payments flow through your existing Square account.
- **Multi-location** — One app, all locations. Customers choose store; orders and status stay location-aware.
- **Kitchen-ready** — Works with your current KDS (Layout or Square). Orders appear where your team already works.

This documentation is for **owners**, **technical evaluators**, and **partners** who want a clear picture of how the system works, how it integrates with Square, and how we think about reliability and security—without implementation details or internal systems.

## Who this is for

| Audience | What you’ll find here |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Multi-location coffee shop owners** | How Layout fits with Square, what you get (app, dashboard, kitchen), and how locations and branding work. |
| **Technical evaluators** | High-level architecture, integration flow, reliability and security principles, and multi-tenant design. |
| **Investors & partners** | Platform scope, integration strategy, and how we position reliability and security. |

## What you get

- **Customer app** — Branded iOS app: menu, locations, cart, checkout (Square), loyalty, and order status.
- **Merchant dashboard** — Branding, menu and locations (synced from Square), order settings, loyalty, and analytics.
- **Kitchen panel** — Location-based order display and status flow (accepted → making → ready → completed), with optional Layout or Square KDS.

Payments and catalog stay in Square; Layout orchestrates the app experience, order flow, and kitchen display so everything stays consistent across locations.
