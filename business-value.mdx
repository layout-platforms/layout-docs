description: What Layout Mobile delivers for multi-location coffee shops and how it fits with Square and your operations.
---

This page summarizes the **business value** of Layout Mobile for multi-location coffee shop owners and for partners or investors evaluating the platform. It stays high-level and avoids implementation detail.

## For multi-location coffee shop owners

### One branded app, all locations

You get a **customer-facing mobile app** under your brand—your name, logo, and colors—that works across all your locations. Customers choose a store, browse your menu, and pay with card or Apple Pay. You don’t build or host the app; Layout runs the platform and keeps it in sync with your Square account.

### Works with what you already use

Layout is built for merchants who already use **Square** for POS and payments. We don’t replace Square; we add a mobile ordering and kitchen layer on top:

- **Catalog and locations** — Managed in Square; we sync so the app always reflects your current menu and stores.
- **Payments** — Processed by Square. Settlement and reporting stay in your Square account.
- **Kitchen** — Use our kitchen panel (Layout KDS) or keep Square KDS; we support both.

So you keep one system for register and payments; we add the app and optional kitchen display.

### Control and visibility

- **Dashboard** — Configure branding, which locations are live, order and pickup behavior, and (if you use it) loyalty. View analytics and operations in one place.
- **Kitchen panel** — See orders by location and move them through status (e.g. accepted → making → ready → completed). Optional customer-facing status and notifications when using Layout KDS.
- **Multi-location** — One app, many locations; orders and reporting are location-aware so you can see performance by store.

## For technical evaluators

### Clear integration model

- **Square as source of truth** — Catalog, locations, and payments flow through Square. We sync and orchestrate; we don’t duplicate payment processing or replace your POS.
- **Secure, tenant-scoped** — OAuth for Square; tokens and data scoped by company (and location). No cross-tenant access; webhooks verified.
- **Reliability** — Idempotent payment creation to avoid double charges; order state checks; webhook verification; sync via events and scheduled jobs.

So: **predictable boundaries** (Square vs Layout), **isolation** (tenant/location), and **designed-in** reliability and security.

### Architecture and operations

- **Hosted platform** — No merchant-hosted servers or databases. Layout runs the backend, dashboard, and panel; the customer app talks to our APIs and (where used) real-time channels for status.
- **Documented at the right level** — This documentation focuses on concepts, integration flow, reliability, and security. No internal schemas, secrets, or low-level APIs—suitable for evaluation and partner discussions.

## For investors and partners

### Market and product fit

Layout targets **multi-location coffee shops (and similar merchants) on Square** who want:

- A **branded mobile app** without building and maintaining their own.
- **Alignment with Square** — same catalog, locations, and payments they already use.
- **Multi-location and kitchen** — one app, location-aware orders, and optional Layout or Square KDS.

The product is scoped to **add value on top of Square**, not replace it—reducing integration risk and fitting how these merchants already operate.

### Technical credibility

- **Integration** — Square OAuth, catalog/location sync, webhooks, idempotent payments. Clear separation of responsibilities (Square = payments and catalog source; Layout = app, orders, kitchen).
- **Security and reliability** — Tenant isolation, no card data in Layout, verified webhooks, idempotency. Principles are documented and designed into the flow.
- **Multi-tenant, multi-location** — Company and location model is explicit; data and access are scoped accordingly.

This documentation is the main artifact for **technical credibility**: it’s structured, professional, and focused on architecture, integration, reliability, and security without exposing internals.
